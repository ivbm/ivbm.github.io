<h2>Visualisation description:</h2>
<p> The graph above shows the crimes registered in San Francisco in the period 2003-2015. All the crimes are represented on the map with dots.
    The crimes have been divided in four classes depending on category. Violent categories of crimes like "ASSAULT, ROBBERY, SEX OFFENSES FORCIBLE, KIDNAPPING, ARSON,
    EXTORTION, SUICIDE" are represented with red dots, theft related incidents such as 'BURGLARY', 'LARCENY/THEFT', 'STOLEN PROPERTY' and 'VEHICLE THEFT' are pink,
    and "PROSTITUTION" is orange. All remaining crimes are black dots.
    Two sliders have been constructed in order to see the density of the crimes on the maps depending on the day of the week it happened and for various time frames.
    A counter in the top left of the map shows the number of crimes after the filters are applied. There's also the possibility of zooming in and out the map.
</p>
<p>Thus, we can conclude which day of the week the most crimes have happened (Wednesday) and which hours of the day they mostly occur (15-18). The time frame with the
    least criminal activity is 03-06, but a higher proportion of these are violent crimes. The days with the most crimes in this time frame are Saturday and Sunday,
    indicating that the weekend might influence people's criminal behaviour.
    Another mention, which is visible in the chart, is that most of the crimes are happening in the north-eastern part of San Francisco.

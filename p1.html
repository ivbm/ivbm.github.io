        At first glance, the time visualisation would seem to suffer from the stacked bar syndrome, where it is hard to<br/>
        compare unaligned 'heights' of different segments. However, each segment can be clicked and shown in isolation,<br/>
        displaying clear knowledge of the problem as well as an interactive solution. Furthermore, the initial visualisation<br/>
        provides detailed information on mouseover. This is more readily available than the seperate graphs, and shows<br/>
        activity percentage at a given time of day.<br/>
        &emsp;The ease of access is limited by the lacking height of certain segments, e.g. segments generally below 2%<br/>
        of overall actitivy. These can be difficult to pinpoint with the mouse, and as such the mouseover information<br/>
        as well as the seperate graphs are difficult to acquire. At this stage it can be hard to even identify the<br/>
        represented activity.

    <p>
        The interactive graph shows the evolution in obesity in the United States based on the different states, for a period <br/>
        of 14 years. The proportions of each state's normal, overweight and obese people are shown with pie charts or target graphs <br/>
        The diameter of the pie chart or target graph visualizes the population size, which might not be <br/>
        relevant for the goal of the visualisation of obesity in the states in USA. <br/>
        An intuitive feature of the graph, is that the percentages of each category is shown in a small pop-up <br/>
        The interactivity is very intuituve and it's a nice way of showing the evolution of obesity. <br/>
        when moused over a state's pie chart or target graph. <br/>
        As each state's chart is shown over the state on the map, it is hard to compare the states and see which one <br/>
        has the most obese population, for an example. <br/>
        Without holding the cursor over a state, it is very hard to see the proportions represented in the pies. <br/>
        The states with small populations have so small charts, that is is near impossible to see the proportions. <br/>

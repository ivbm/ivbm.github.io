        At first glance, the time visualisation would seem to suffer from the stacked bar syndrome, where it is hard to<br/>
        compare unaligned 'heights' of different segments. However, each segment can be clicked and shown in isolation,<br/>
        displaying clear knowledge of the problem as well as an interactive solution. Furthermore, the initial visualisation<br/>
        provides detailed information on mouseover. This is more readily available than the seperate graphs, and shows<br/>
        activity percentage at a given time of day.<br/>
        &emsp;The ease of access is limited by the lacking height of certain segments, e.g. segments generally below 2%<br/>
        of overall actitivy. These can be difficult to pinpoint with the mouse, and as such the mouseover information<br/>
        as well as the seperate graphs are difficult to acquire. At this stage it can be hard to even identify the<br/>
        represented activity.

    </li>
    <p>
        The interactive graph shows the evolution in obesity in the United States based on the different states, for a period <br/>
        of 14 years. The proportions of each state (normal, overweight and obese people) are shown with pie charts or target graphs. <br/>
        The diameter of the pie chart or target graph visualizes the population size, which might not be relevant for the goal <br/>
        of the visualisation of obesity in the states in USA. <br/>
        A feature of the graph is that the percentages of each category is shown in a small pop-up. <br/>
        The interactivity is very intuituve and it's a nice way of showing the evolution of obesity when moused over a <br/>
        state's pie chart or target graph. <br/>
        As each state's chart is shown over the state on the map, it is hard to compare the states and see which one <br/>
        has the most obese population, for an example. <br/>
        Without holding the cursor over a state, it is very hard to see the proportions represented in the pies. <br/>
        The states with small populations have so small charts, that is is near impossible to see the proportions. <br/>

        An interactive visualization I would like to be able to do after finishing this course is, for example, <br/>
        a two-dimensional scatter plot where I can see all posts from a dataset as they are mapped by emotion dimensions. <br/>
        The data consists of the posts collected from a facebook page of a company and is processed in order to get <br/>
        the emotions related to each post. If I would mouse over a point in the plot, I could be able to see who said what <br/>
        (the user's reactions), and what values of sentiment (from -1 to 1) and arousal (from 0 to 1) were detected.  <br/>
        Posts should be colored taking into account the most important emotional state that characterie them. <br/>
        The size of each point should show a probability score representing the importance of the classification I've done. <br/>
        The chart should enable us to see interactive individual or combined emotions (for example joy and excitement both). <br/>
        The intended audience of this chart would be the researcher doing the analysis or the company interested in the <br/>
        posts (related to specific important events) and emotions of the users. <br/>

        I would like to be able to create a sort of wordnet. This would highlight a 'main' word, shown along with many other<br/>
        words, perhaps ranked by the frequency of their co-occurence or some other relation. From it you should be able to<br/>
        navigate to different main words, either by clicking them in the presented visualisation, or by searching on them.<br/> 
        &emsp;Alternatively, clicking a co-occuring word could show examples of that and the main word together, either<br/>
        common constructions or just simple examples.

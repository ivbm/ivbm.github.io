        At first glance, the time visualisation would seem to suffer from the stacked bar syndrome, where it is hard to<br/>
        compare unaligned 'heights' of different segments. However, each segment can be clicked and shown in isolation,<br/>
        displaying clear knowledge of the problem as well as an interactive solution. Furthermore, the initial visualisation<br/>
        provides detailed information on mouseover. This is more readily available than the seperate graphs, and shows<br/>
        activity percentage at a given time of day.<br/>
        &emsp;The ease of access is limited by the lacking height of certain segments, e.g. segments generally below 2%<br/>
        of overall actitivy. These can be difficult to pinpoint with the mouse, and as such the mouseover information<br/>
        as well as the seperate graphs are difficult to acquire. At this stage it can be hard to even identify the<br/>
        represented activity. <br/>

    <p>
        The interactive graph shows the evolution in obesity in the United States based on the different states, for a period <br/>
        of 14 years. The proportions of each state (normal, overweight and obese people) are shown with pie charts or target graphs. <br/>
        The diameter of the pie chart or target graph visualizes the population size, which might not be relevant for the goal <br/>
        of the visualisation of obesity in the states in USA. <br/>
        A feature of the graph is that the percentages of each category is shown in a small pop-up. <br/>
        The interactivity is very intuituve and it's a nice way of showing the evolution of obesity when moused over a <br/>
        state's pie chart or target graph. <br/>
        As each state's chart is shown over the state on the map, it is hard to compare the states and see which one <br/>
        has the most obese population, for an example. <br/>
        Without holding the cursor over a state, it is very hard to see the proportions represented in the pies. <br/>
        The states with small populations have so small charts, that is is near impossible to see the proportions. <br/>

        An interactive visualization I would like to be able to do after finishing this course is, for example, <br/>
        a two-dimensional scatter plot where I can see all posts from a dataset as they are mapped by emotion dimensions. <br/>
        The data consists of the posts collected from a facebook page of a company and is processed in order to get <br/>
        the emotions related to each post. If I would mouse over a point in the plot, I could be able to see who said what <br/>
        (the user's reactions), and what values of sentiment (from -1 to 1) and arousal (from 0 to 1) were detected.  <br/>
        Posts should be colored taking into account the most important emotional state that characterise them. <br/>
        The size of each point should show a probability score representing the importance of the classification I've done. <br/>
        The chart should enable us to see interactive individual or combined emotions (for example joy and excitement both). <br/>
        The intended audience of this chart would be the researcher doing the analysis or the company interested in the <br/>
        posts (related to specific important events) and emotions of the users. <br/>

        The interactive visualisation I would like to make is a visualisation of the interests and collection of users on the <br/>
        site for game collectors called <a href="http://www.playright.dk/samler/">PlayRight</a>. <br/>
        On this site people who collect video games are able to document their collection. The visualization should be able to <br/>
        show the proportions of video games on each hardware system, for the whole site, a specific group of people (by region <br/>
        or age for an example) or a single user. <br>
        &emsp;It should also be able to show the most popular games, by year, hardware and publisher. The result could be shown by <br/>
        the image of the game popping up in front of the rest of the visualisation. <br>
        &emsp;A nice feature would be if people on the site could be matched up by their interests and ratings of games. <br/>
        This visualiation would help people on the site get a better overview of their collection, and maybe help them <br/>
        find new games for their collection. It would also tell a story of the history of gaming, as you would be able to <br/>
        see the most popular games over time.

        I would like to be able to create a sort of wordnet. This would highlight a 'main' word, shown along with many other<br/>
        words, perhaps ranked by the frequency of their co-occurence or something similar. From it you should be able to<br/>
        navigate to different main words, either by clicking them in the presented visualisation, or by searching on them.<br/> 
        &emsp;Alternatively, clicking a co-occuring word could show examples of that and the main word together, either<br/>
        common constructions or just simple examples. On mouseover, the words should display their co-occurence frequency.<br/>
        Big frequency leaps between two words could be indicated by borders, as illustated. The frequencies would be<br/>
        calculated based on a language corpus.<br/>
        &emsp;The ranking of co-occurent words could be of interest to linguists interested in frame semantics or similar<br/>
        topics. The exact frequency is in this case secondary to the ranking, and bar plots would confuse this relation.<br/>

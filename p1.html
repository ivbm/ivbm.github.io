        At first glance, the time visualisation would seem to suffer from the stacked bar syndrome, where it is hard to<br/>
        compare unaligned 'heights' of different segments. However, each segment can be clicked and shown in isolation,<br/>
        displaying clear knowledge of the problem as well as an interactive solution. Furthermore, the initial visualisation<br/>
        provides detailed information on mouseover. This is more readily available than the seperate graphs, and shows<br/>
        activity percentage at a given time of day.<br/>
        &emsp;The ease of access is limited by the lacking height of certain segments, e.g. segments generally below 2%<br/>
        of overall actitivy. These can be difficult to pinpoint with the mouse, and as such the mouseover information<br/>
        as well as the seperate graphs are difficult to acquire. At this stage it can be hard to even identify the<br/>
        represented activity.

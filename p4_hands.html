<p id="handInfo">Visualization description, results and conclusion:</p>
<p>The dataset, on which this visualization is based, contains: </p>
 <p> - a csv file with 40 rows, each representing the shape of a hand. Each row has 112 dimensions (the first 56 are the x coordinates while the next ones are the y coordinates) </p>
 <p>  - a csv file that represents the data obtained after performing the PCA. The files contains 40 rows, each representing the principal components (less dimensions) for each hand. </p>
 <p>   Choosing everytime two of the principal components, is helping the user to evaluate the shape of the underlying structure of a hand.
    PCA finds the principal components of the data, these components are highlighting the underlying structure in the data. The principal components found after performing
    the algorithm are the directions where there is the most variance, the directions where the data is most spread out.
    In the visualization above, you can choose 2 of the components that were generated by the PCA algorithm in the right panel. A scatter-plot with the distribution of
    the points is displayed in the right panel by choosing the two components. When clicking on one of the points (representing a hand) of this scatter-plot (the right one),
    the shape of a hand is displayed in the left panel. Also, the click on this point will generate the index of the datafile row that will be displayed in the left panel.
    When mouse-over the left panel, the shape of the generated hand is outlined through a line between points.</p>
